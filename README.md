Welcome to the **Odin Recipes Webpage** project! This is a beginner-friendly project where I'm building a basic webpage to showcase some of my favorite persian cuisine recipes. The project starts with plain HTML and will gradually incorporate CSS as I become more comfortable with web development.

## About the Project

This project is a simple webpage that displays a collection of easy-to-follow recipes. It's designed to help me practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills. The initial version of the project focuses on structuring the content using HTML, and I plan to enhance the design and layout with CSS as I progress.

## Features

- **Recipe Listings**: A collection of simple recipes displayed on the webpage.
- **Basic HTML Structure**: Clean and semantic HTML to organize the content.
- **Future CSS Enhancements**: Plans to add styling, responsive design, and visual improvements as I learn more about CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Will be added later to style the webpage and improve its appearance.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and hosting the project.
