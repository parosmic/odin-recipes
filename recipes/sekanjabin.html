        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sekanjabin (sometimes spelled sekanjubin or sekanjamin, among others) is a refreshing Persian drink, sometimes even prepared for medicinal purposes. Earliest references to this concoction date from the 10th century AD. The syrup keeps almost indefinitely without refrigeration, and the drink is particularly tasty with fruits. Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
