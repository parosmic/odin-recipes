        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bastani is flavored with rose water, the key to this vibrant and delicious saffron and rose ice cream. Rose water has a strong flavor, so start with 2 tablespoons if you want a more delicate floral note.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>5 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>2 to 4 tablespoons rose water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, crushed to a powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped raw, unsalted pistachios (optional), plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>dried rose petals, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl until thick and pale yellow, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Warm the milk, rose water, and vanilla in a medium saucepan over medium heat just until mixture lightly simmers. Gradually pour milk mixture into yolk mixture, whisking constantly.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) and mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Add saffron, stirring until mixture takes on a deep-yellow color, about 1 minute. Stir in whipping cream. Cover surface with plastic wrap; chill at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Churn mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturerâ€™s directions until it reaches the texture of soft-serve ice cream. Add pistachios (if using) during the last few minutes of churning.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer to a freezer-safe container, cover surface with parchment paper, and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Scoop into bowls. Garnish with pistachios and rose petals. (Freeze in an airtight container up to 1 week.)</li>
        </ol>
